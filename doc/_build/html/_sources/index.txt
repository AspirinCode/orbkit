Overview
=========

orbkit is a parallel Python program package for post-processing 
wavefunction data extracted from output files of MOLPRO_ (Molden File Format), 
TURBOMOLE_ (Molden file format), GAMESS-US_, and Gaussian_ (.log File and Formatted Checkpoint File). 

Computational capabilities using arbitrary grids:

- Atomic orbitals, molecular orbitals, electron density, and the spatial derivatives of these quantities
- Reduced electron density
- Electron density for selected molecular orbitals
- Atom-projected electron density
- Molecular orbital transition electronic flux density

The requirements for the input files, the usage via the terminal or within a 
Python program, as well as the limitations of orbkit are explained in the :doc:`manual`. 
Information about the central variables and descriptions to all orbkit 
modules are presented under :doc:`funcref`.

The orbkit support team, Axel, Gunter, and Vincent, welcomes every new
user and will be available to answer your questions. For any change
requests, do not hesitate to contact the orbkit support team.
